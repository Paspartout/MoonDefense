This is my game for the MiniJam77, which takes place on the moon.
You are the pilot of a spacefighter and your task is to defend the moon from evil alien forces.

Controls

​- WASD: Movement
​- Space: Shoot
​- Shift: Fly slower(only useful in level 4)
​
Notes

The game was my first attempt at making a shmup/bullet hell but I mostly got distracted by other things like fancy animations, tweens and stuff :)
Not sure how hard the game is for other players. It is beatable without loosing
a single hp but very hard. I started with 3 hp but buffed them to 5 since 3 felt to hard for newer players.
I had Ideas for Bosses, Puzzles, Powerups and more but well can't do that much in 72 hours.
​
Tips​

​- You can spam the spacebar to shoot faster
- When holding the spacebar though you move slower and hence can aim easier
